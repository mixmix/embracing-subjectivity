1. truth
  - current state of systems
  - authorship
    - what is recorded, where
    - how records presented

2. building with less objective truth

3. patchwork
  - messages
    - where are they?
    - content addressable storage (hashes)
    - minimal set of required data
      - type
      - content
      - author 
      - timestamp
    - gossip

  - identity
    - authoring?
    - who is who?
    - meta-data

  - perception 
    - what arrives in eyes vs perception
    - raw data vs seeing

4. alternative interfaces
  - patchbay
  - ssb graph
  - git-ssb
  - ferment 

5. challenges
  - building shared stable truth
    - what are the message types?
    - how far should you gossip?
  - how do you code the right sorts of trust? (groups)
  - maps
  - spam / abuse
    
6. comparison of truth / coming back to the web
  - where is the authorship?
  - who decides the truth?

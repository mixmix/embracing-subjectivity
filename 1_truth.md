Here's a perspective on recent history.

Society is made up of actors
Shared truth enables actors to coordinate more complex stuff.

Authorship of truth == power to shape direction.
  - prophet / monarch 

Capital-t Truth
  - extreme: truth that's trancendental / authored above you, absolutism, idealism
  - opinionated framework
  - government defined identity
  - social media identity
  - community built identity
  - extreme: nhilism
Emergent truth


- god 
- government
- social media
- community 
- individual

---

Society is shaped by its systems.
- How we code our systems has and is shaping society.
- bitcoin + torrents are examples. why are these so interesting?
  - commonality: Decentralisation
    - authorship
    - identity

    - (accountability)
    - organisation

(Objective) Truth < --- > Subjective truth

Top down / bottom up

- social truth (formed around campfire)
- objective Truth
  - states, religions
- too much Truth
  - top-down truth/ centralised authorship of truth
  - institution, absolutism
- oscillation (dynamic equlibrium)
  - rennaisance
  - individualistic consumerism

- hybrid systems:
  - strong institution-defined identity
  - freedom to author
    - inside a walled garden
  - mining of emergent truth

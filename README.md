background-image: url(island_replication.jpeg)
background-color: black
color: white

## Why care?

???

- mad science
- no servers = different internet
  - islands (boats, inland, off-world) 
  - disasters
  - social/ political

## Patchbay 

![patchbay](./patchbay.png)

???

- it exists
- it is very different to the internet you know
  - this is a system which behaves _like a group of humans_
    - very messy
    - anti-fragile


- each user 
  - has freedom of speech
  - can only see so far
  - has their own perspective
  - sovereinty over their experience

- applications are all part of the same space
  - github and patchbay

## challenges, solutions, & side effects

???

as explored through scuttlebutt

challenges
  - identity
  - authorisation
  - meaning 
technology needed to help

- interesting parts 
  - challenges, learnings, funny noticings
  - _spoiler_ - the more we build, the more we see a system that looks  like 'people space' / offline-world / like human society has for millenia.
    - **either** similar constraints lead to similar dynamics
    - **or** the shape of it makes it easy to pour social intuitions into 

- moving away fom capital T truth -> subjectivity

Alt arc - 

this is a story about truth

TRUTH (plato)  - there's this duality, this absolute perfect truth
CHURCH (god) - there's this truth
SCIENCE - there is truth

There is no truth - nihilism, post-modernism, the individual

FACEBOOK - here's some political truth / the truth about what's important


There has always been truth - it's just not in the individual or the trancendental or holy
